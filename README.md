# Anomalyze: Multi-Dimensional Network Forensic Engine

**Anomalyze** is an advanced analytics platform designed to detect complex security threats across telecommunication and network infrastructures. Unlike standard log parsers, Anomalyze correlates data from **Call Detail Records (CDR)**, **Internet Protocol Detail Records (IPDR)**, and **Firewall Logs** to identify sophisticated threats that span multiple domains.

The engine powers **52+ forensic algorithms** and integrates **7 specialized Machine Learning models** to flag anomalies ranging from SIM cloning to covert DNS tunneling.

## The AI Core: Machine Learning Modules

Anomalyze moves beyond static rule-based detection by employing ML models to catch zero-day anomalies and behavioral deviations:

* **DNS Tunneling Detection:** Identifies covert data exfiltration attempts hiding within DNS queries.
* **Behavioral Baselining:** Establishes "normal" user behavior profiles in firewall logs to flag subtle deviations.
* **IP Clustering Detection:** Uses unsupervised learning to detect coordinated botnet-like behavior across multiple IPs.
* **Data Transfer Pattern Tracking:** Classifies network traffic to spot anomalous volume spikes indicative of data theft.
* **Time-Based Access Patterns:** Learns typical user login hours to detect "impossible" or off-hour access.
* **Burst Call Detection:** Identifies rapid-fire, high-frequency call patterns often associated with robocalling or fraud.
* **HTTP Status Code Analysis:** Detects scanning attacks and server misconfigurations via status code distribution anomalies.

## The Co-Relation Engine (Cross-Domain Analysis)

*The "Wow Factor" of Anomalyze is its ability to connect the dots between distinct log sources.*

* **SIM Swap Behavior:** Correlates SIM card changes (CDR) with sudden shifts in IP activity or location (IPDR).
* **Insider Threat Detector:** Flags employees accessing suspicious resources combined with off-hour login attempts.
* **Geo-Location Anomaly:** Detects "impossible travel" by comparing physical call locations with simultaneous network login locations.
* **Device Spoofing:** Identifies mismatches between MAC addresses and IP usage patterns across sessions.
